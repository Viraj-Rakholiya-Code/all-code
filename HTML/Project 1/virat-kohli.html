        <h2>Virat’s Cricket Career</h2>

        <div class="career-center">
            <ul>
                <li>The List A debut forb
                    <b>Virat</b> happened in February 2006. On that day, he played for Delhi against
                    Services. He did not get a chance to bat, but Delhi won. Virat got a listing in over 273 List A
                    matches.
                </li>
                <li>On 23rd November 2006, Virat made his Ranji Trophy debut. It was against Tamil Nadu. He showed his
                    true grit when he played for Delhi against Karnataka in December. It was the day after his father
                    died. His 90 runs proved critical for the match.</li>
                <li>This changed Virat’s life. To quote his mother, “Overnight, he became a much more mature person. He
                    took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It’s as if his life hinged totally on
                    cricket after that day.”</li>
                <li>During the Sri Lanka tour, Virat joined the Indian team on 18th August 2008. In the 4th game, he
                    made his match-winning score of 54 runs. The series was won by India 3-2. At times he was not
                    selected for the national team, but he still was showing his ability. </li>
                <li> He was selected for the 4-team Emerging Players Tournament (July & August 2009 – Australia). Virat,
                    with 398 runs, was the tournament’s leading scorer, and he calls this tournament his career’s
                    turning point. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>An up-and-coming talent hailing from Delhi represented <b><i>Royal Challengers Bangalore</i></b> in
                    the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League.
                    Indian Premier League championships in 2010 and 2011. </li>
                <li> His name was Virat Kohli. He was coming at the back of a successful campaign in the Under-19 World
                    Cup 2008, which saw him notch up 235 runs in six games at a strike rate of 94.75 and lead India's
                    Under-19 team to glory. </li>
                <li>But no one in their wildest dreams would have ever imagined that the excellent batter would become
                    one of the finest cricketers of his generation</li>
                <li>Kohli has obliterated batters with his marauding bat and made world cricket his happy hunting
                    ground.
                <li>He has also established supremacy in the IPL arena and amassed truckloads of runs in the marquee
                    event.</li>
                </li>
                <li>However, Kohli found it tough to thrive in the lucrative T20 tournament in the starting editions. He
                    had a dismal campaign in his debut season and could only score 165 runs in 13 matches at a strike
                    rate of 105.09. In IPL 2009, the Delhi-born did show glimpses of brilliance but was inconsistent
                    with his performances and could only score 246 runs in 16 outings at a strike rate of 112.32.</li>
